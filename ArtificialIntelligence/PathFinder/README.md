Consider an agent placed in cell 2, who wants to go to cell 25.implement the breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms to find the path from cell 2 to 25.

Write a program that implements the A* algorithm that finds the optimal path from 2 to 25. Use a suitable heuristic. At the end of each iteration, you should print the content in the CLOSED and OPEN sets, along with the path constructed to the standard console output.
